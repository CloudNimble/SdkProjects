Instructions
========================================

1) Let the wizard complete. It will throw errors. Ignore them, the EF tools have not been updated for VS2017 yet.

2) Close the solution and re-open it.

3) Right-click the T4 templates and select "Run Custom Tool". If VS pops up a dialog saying it has conflicting changes, select "Discard".
